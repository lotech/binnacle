/**
 * Energy use from the car's power reading (code 10 curentergyval: magnitude plus a regen flag;
 * driving peaks around 210, taken as kW, still to confirm against the car's own trip screen) and
 * speed. Power and speed are held between samples and integrated over time; a gap over MAX_GAP_MS
 * (dash stopped, feed paused) is skipped rather than guessed. Fed from DashApp on every code 10, so
 * it keeps counting while CarPlay or the camera is in front; reset when the feed changes (demo/live).
 *
 * Keeps a trip since the dash started (the car's sleep stops the dash, so this is roughly one
 * drive), distance segments of SEGMENT_KM for the recent Wh/km (by distance, however long it took),
 * and BUCKET_MS time buckets for the power graph (by time, empty where there was no data).
